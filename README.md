Look below the heading "JavaScript behavior" for the section that says "The tabs plugin also works with pills."

## notes
For the email and phone number links, I made them a tags and gave them an href of "mailto:BLAdminservices@gmail.com" and "tel:314-603-2840" respectively so that you can click them if you want instead of having to go to a different app.  I wasn't sure if that is a wanted feature or not; I just thought it was cool.

I used a div with the container for spacing in larger windows, but I added a margin to the "tab-content" in the mobile mode because I think it looks a little sharper.  It is a matter of preference, though.

Ben took the pattern on the business card that we recieved and made 2 images based on that pattern.  I went with a royalty free background (country-quilt3), but I left the other images in in-case we wanted to do something with them.
